This project contains all necessary files to start an industrial melting furnace using a Siemens PLC S7-1214 DC/DC/DC according to ABNT NBR12313 (Combustion system - Control and safety for fuel gases utilization
in low temperature process).

All the exterior part of the proccess (outside the PLC) is simulated using the help of a SCADA Software, in this case Action.Net by Spin Engenharia

Please note that this job does NOT control the furnace's temperature and just concerns itself with the secure start of the flame.
